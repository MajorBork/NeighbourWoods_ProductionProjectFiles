# COLOR SPACE

Your project MUST be configured to use Linear color.
Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings > Color Space

If you need to use Gamma, then you'll need to make a modification in
the shader code to map RGB to linear RGB and back. Otherwise,
shoot me a request to add it (via Twitter or GitHub or something).
